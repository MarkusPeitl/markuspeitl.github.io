[rnmd - markdown execution runtime](https://github.com/MarkusPeitl/rnmd/)  

**rnmd** is a markdown execution runtime which can be used to run code contained inside of a markdown file.
The vision behind it is to have your documentation and code together in one place and not maintain 2 versions of the same code.

[node typescript handlebars template](https://github.com/MarkusPeitl/node-typescript-handlebars-template)  

Simple template repo for building quick and small web applications with NodeJS, typescript and express. Uses handlebars as the tempate engine.
as mocha as a testing framework. Uses nodemon and the watch mode of the typescript compiler to recompile and restart the application as soon as changes occur.

[Sample xml to html parser in C#](https://github.com/MarkusPeitl/Xml2HtmlConverter)  

Just a showcase of this simple application including unit tests.  
Not really meant as a standalone application, just for using it as reference.

[Power Mind Map](https://github.com/MarkusPeitl/PowerMindMap)  

Is a highly performant windows UWP mind mapping application also available on the windows store.
As this was very quickly built it is not the best example of software engineering.
Therefore this project is depreciated and i started to reimplement a similar application with Angular and Nodejs.
